## network-vis-plugin 0.33.0-rc.4 - (2025-09-12)

**New features:**

 * Clarify node size scaling (#12)\
   The `ellipse`, `circle`, `database` and `box` node shapes don't scale
   according to the number of documents. Instead, its size is based on
   the size of the label text. A text below these options now warns about
   this.
 * Upgrade to OpenSearch Dashboards 3.2.0\
   Upgrade plugin compatibility with OpenSearch Dashboards 3.2.0.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Apply node size top value (#12)\
   The node size top value setting was not being applied to the node-
   relation visualizations properly.
